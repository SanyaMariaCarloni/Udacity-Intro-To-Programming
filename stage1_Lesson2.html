			<h2><u>Lesson 1: Basics of the Web & HTML</u></h2>
		</div>	
			<div class="lesson-title">
			<h3><b>What is The WWW?</b></h3>
		</div>
		<div class="lesson-description">
			The WWW, or more formally <b>World Wide Web</b>, is comprised of various documents. These documents range from videos, photos, audio files and text documents. The web is essentially considered <b>cloudbased</b> because it gets to us through the airwaves but it is not invisible, really. The web is really a mass of computer servers that communicate with one another. In order for it to communicate properly, it needs the help of <b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</b>, <em>HTTP</em>, and <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html" target="_blank"> browsers</a> (or clients) to fully function. Again, it is through the <em><b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</b></em>, that facilitates communication between the client and servers.

			<h3><b>Are Computers <em>Really</em> Stupid?</b></h3>
		</div>
		<div class="lesson-description">
			Computers lack the ability, unless programmed, to make decisions on their own. Computers rely on us to tell them what to do. They are a tool for our use to produce and distribute digital information. So, a tiny mistake in code by a programmer can cause a program to not function properly.

		<div class="lesson-title">
			<h3><b>HTML</b></h3>
		</div>
		<div class="lesson-description">
			Hypertext Markup Language is a very broad <em>markup</em> which we use to tell computers to do things, specifically with webpages. We want the computer to know how we want to add context and structure so with HTML you can create this! It is made up of:
			<ul>
				<li><b>text content</b> - what you see</li>
				<li><b>markup</b> - what it looks like</li>
				<li><b>references</b> - to other documents such as images and video</li>
				<li><b>links</b> - to other pages</li>
			</ul>	
			<p>All of the above are created by <b>tags</b> with emphasis on certain <em>elements</em> and <em>attributes.</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				Tag names are always the same except the closing tag has a slash.<br> For example: &lt;name&gt;text/content&lt;/name&gt;
			</p>
			<p>
				Aditionaly, we have:
				<ul style="list-style-type:none">
					<li>&lt;span&gt; -- <b>inline</b></li>
					<li>&lt;div&gt; -- <b>block</b></li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
			Elements add structure to the HTML document where as Attributes provide additional information to the browser.

			<h3><b>Whitespaces</b></h3>
		</div>
		<div class="lesson-description">
			<p>
				Whitespaces render multiple lines; line break. <br>We have <b>inline</b> and <b>block</b>. The difference between the two are self-explanatory, to many. <b>Inline</b> keeps text/content on the same line and appears, well, <em>in line</em>; whereas <b>block</b> makes text/content appear within an invisible box.
				<br>Some examples of block element tags are: &lt;p&gt;, &lt;div&gt;,&lt;h1&gt;. Here is a quick video recapping <a href="https://youtu.be/Amp7VaoALYg" target=_blank> whitespaces</a> in HTML.

			<h2><b><u>Lesson 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</u></b></h2>
		</div>
		<div class="lesson-title">
			<h3>Developer Tools within a Browser (specifically Google Chrome)</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="lesson-description">
			<p>
				HTML elements can be manipulated within the devloper tools of a browser. With Google Chrome, you can adjust certain elements to see their differneced but can not save to the actual .html file. Whatever adjustments are made within developer tools, has to be adjusted within the actual HTML document.

			<h3>Tree-like Structure in HTML</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="lesson-description">
			<p>
				A tree-like structure is a way of sectioning data in a heirarchy. There are the tree elements, that resemble the base of the tree, called nodes; connecting elements which act as the branches and finally end-nodes, which have no data associated to them.
				<br>The back-end shows a wave of symbols and letters. Whereas, in the front-end, the information/text/content/data displayed appears as content within invisible (or visible with CSS affixed) boxes. These boxes are essentially caccooned within other boxes... Kind of reminds me of the Fibonacci Sequence.

		<div class="lesson-title">
			<h3>HTML -- CSS -- DOM</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="lesson-description">
			<p>
				<b>HTML</b>	defines the content and structure of a page.
				<p><b>CSS</b> defines the style. It allows the programmer to use specific syntax and rules to change <em>how</em> elements look on a page; the size, font, color, background and border.
				<p><b>DOM</b> is the Document Object Model and tree-like structure.
			</p>

		<div class="lesson-title">
			<h3>Text Editors</h3>		
		</div>
		<div class="lesson-description">
			<p>
				Text editors make a programmers life so much eaier today than in previous years. There are many different text editors out there, free to use, much like the one I am using; Sublime Text. Some text editors will close the opening tag with the end tag by pressing tab. That's super efficient!
